Steps : https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#publishing-your-library

1. Create angular project using command : ng new <project-name> - This is will create workspace for angular project.

2. Create angular library using command : ng generate library <library-name> - This will create project folder in the angular
   project's root folder and <library-name> folder inside project folder.

   - /project/<library-name> folder will contain our code for library that we are going to publish as npm package.
   - The public API for your library is maintained in the public-api.ts file in your library folder. Anything exported
   from this file is made public when your library is imported into an application.
   - Specify dependencies of your library as peerDependency or devDependency in /project/<library-name>package.json. Do
   no specify any dependency as dependency.
   - Creating library will also makes changes to some existing files angular.json tsconfig.json. package.json

3. Add code of your library.

4. Take build for library using command : ng build <library-name>

5. We can use angular library in two ways. One publish as npm package and import or use locally.

6. Publish npm package. In order to publish your library as npm package you need to account opened at npmjs.org, if you
   do not have open first. And use the following commands to publish.

   - cd <project-name>/dist/<library-name>
   - npm adduser
        This command will asks you username, password and email you entered when opnening account on npmjs.org.
   - npm login
        This command will asks you username, password and email you entered when opnening account on npmjs.org.
   - npm init
        This command will ask you name, version, description, keywords, license, author, gitub repo url etc.
   - npm publish
   - Now import using command : npm i <library-name> in which project you want to use and add import statement in app.module


7. To use locally first take build for library and then import the module in app.module
   as import {AngularFileDragDropModule} from '../../projects/file-drag-drop/src/lib/angular-file-drag-drop.module';
   and use the component by using the it's selector.

8. To remove/delete npm package

   - npm adduser (if not did before, make user to cd to the project folder)
   - npm login (if not did before, make user to cd to the project folder)
   - npm unpublish
